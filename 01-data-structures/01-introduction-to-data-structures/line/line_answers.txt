Use the line_spec.rb spec file and line.rb skeleton file to help create your class.

-The overall class is the line itself
-A collection of members/people waiting in line, each with a string name
-Front and back to the line
-When you get in line, you start in the back
-If someone leaves the line, everyone else moves forward one space.

Makes most sense as an array because if the line needs to have a front and back it can easily be numbered and organized. Also, each person in line does not need any other attributes.
