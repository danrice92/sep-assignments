Given the following real-world information, conceive a data structure appropriate to represent each within software:

Pixels on a computer screen.

Class screen
Screen has width, height attributes
Screen has many pixels at x and y coordinates (int)

Class pixel
Pixel has red, green, and blue color values (ints), all must be greater than 0, less than 255
If value is less than 0, return 0
If value is greater than 255, return 255

Should be two separate classes for screens and pixels that validate coordinates and colors and make those variables universally accessible if they are valid.
